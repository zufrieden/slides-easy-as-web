					<h3>A javascript library to round corners</h3>
					<img src="src/rounded_corners.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							In 2006, I used some javascript to round corner of a div. It was really modern to use round corner because they were not possible to do (without tricks). I am not ashamed, it was totaly unobstructive and progressive enhancement in mind.
							No javascript, you get square corners. This is still a playfull web nowadays. Trying to push the boundaries a bit.

					<h3>Enthousiasm drives us</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Call it our enthousiasm. But we can't wait using a new web feature. We don't want to wait for a complete acceptance from browser vendor to start playing arround. When we get a full acceptance of border-radius (IE9 in 2011) all the web
							became flat and squared design...
